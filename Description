A Linux based operating system progress : 

04/04/15
Python requires hard drive to pass along information to it in order to access libraries
Therefore when there is no accessible information (during Booting) Python cannot communicate with BIOS

Python CANNOT be used as a language for our OS

04/10/15
Began Linux From Scratch book

Research indicates that Linux based operating system is only option to begin LFS installation
Storage for system is where LFS system will be located, due to installation system transfering all needed packages (think Inheritance)
Windows and MAC OS MAY be used (with a virtualized Linux system) if installing barebones Linux system directly to computer
But virtualization is impossible if installing to bootable USB

A person should responsible for insuring that everyone has USBs that have persistence and a Linux system WHILE having 4 GB + of extra space

04/16/15
Installed Ubuntu on a live USB
NOTE : MORE TESTING (on other computer) SHOULD BE DONE ON USB TO VERIFY IT'S INSTALLED ON SYSTEM RATHER THAN COMPUTER 

Afterwards Every person should test this USB on their computer to see if it's bootable and has persistence
Sowmy currently has USB

04/21/15
USBs that have working persistence seem to not boot on newer versions of Windows

MUST decide if a new Linux based OS should be used as installation system instead
a new file is posted with installation to an alternative Linux system
Everyone should install that ASAP to see if it's an improvement from Ubuntu

04/24/15
Continuing with using Ubuntu because those who plan on using USB can successfully boot using older OS's. 
Other members lack a consistent access to a computer to work on.

04/30/15
The USB I'm working on lacks all files, it is possible we do not have a full version of Ubuntu installed

BEFORE TOMORROW EVERYONE WHO IS STILL WORKING ON A USB SHOULD GO ON LFS AND COMPILE A HOST PREREQUISITE SCRIPT FOR REQUIRED PACKAGES AND NEEDED LIBRARY CONSISTENCY
REPORT YOUR RESULTS TOMORROW

If your USB has a working list of sources in your /etc/apt/sources.list, you should be able to simply enter the commands in terminal : 
"sudo apt-get update"
"sudo apt-get upgrade"
This should at least add a few of the missing packages (internet is required for this task)
Currently researching how Ubuntu repositories work

05/03/15
Sources list can be edited from terminal using :
"sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list"

Once opened in edit mode paste the following text : 
###### Ubuntu Main Repos
deb http://ca.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty main 
deb-src http://ca.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty main 

###### Ubuntu Update Repos
deb http://ca.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty-updates main 
deb-src http://ca.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty-updates main 

Then press ctrl + designated key shown on screen to "write in" and then another ctrl + designated key to exit

Now you should use the update upgrade commands from before to available packages from repository and then download them.

Also note that large chunks of text for testing system requirements can be recalled by simply typing :
"bash version-check.sh"
The above works because we created a bash script on "my computer" folder of Ubuntu using that text

05/10/15
I found how remaining packages can be installed if they are missing after the aforementioned methods :
"sudo apt-cache policy <packageName>"

If a set of numbers is shown after "versions" it means that the package is already installed and just not detected (which means you may move on) or it is an outdated version.

If you must install the package, look for an available version proceeding the text "Version Table", and copy that bolded address EXACTLY into command :
"sudo apt-get install <address here>"

Ask me for help if you're notified that the package "failed to fetch from ... (a html address)"

Now when you are successful in meeting the requirements from version-check script, research on partitioning and mounting filesystem, and we'll discuss

05/16/15
I should have thought of this before but THE USB YOU ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON CANNOT BE UNMOUNTED WHILE BOOTING UBUNTU FROM IT.
Windows cannot detect and access independently boot-capable USBs' partitions.
Therefore make sure your USB has enough 4 GB + even with maximum persistence on it (due to persistence partition not being able to be altered from lack of unmounting option)

USB must be reinstalled if space is not sufficient, another option is to run GParted (Universal Linux Partitioning System) on another USB, boot from that USB, and then partition your current one from that new USB's Ubuntu

URGENT : Sowmy please prepare a 16 GB + USB with Ubuntu on it so I can use the GParted option of partitioning

05/27/15
Partitioning space availability is large enough but memory allocation is extremely small (MB) due to starting block and ending block (gradient between the two creates physical space from USB allocated) being automatically assigned nearly same values

Did some research on this and have yet to encounter someone else facing this problem
Likely that it's faulty construction of partition due to lack of privilleges for one USB to access other

Another partitioning from terminal or other method that does not require operating on HDD (since we are most likely all running Windows, which cannot access bootables) must be found ASAP

06/02/15
Since our USB Ubuntus only require libraries and a working terminal, DELETE ALL UNNECESSARY DEFAULT PROGRAMS IF YOU ARE SUBMITTING YOURS to reduce lag should he test bash scripts.
