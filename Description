A Linux based operating system progress : 

04/04/15
Python requires hard drive to pass along information to it in order to access libraries
Therefore when there is no accessible information (during Booting) Python cannot communicate with BIOS

Python CANNOT be used as a language for our OS

Began Linux From Scratch book

Research indicates that Linux based operating system is only option to begin LFS installation
Storage for system is where LFS system will be located, due to installation system transfering all needed packages (think Inheritance)
Windows and MAC OS MAY be used (with a virtualized Linux system) if installing barebones Linux system directly to computer
But virtualization is impossible if installing to bootable USB

A person should responsible for insuring that everyone has USBs that have persistence and a Linux system WHILE having 4 GB + of extra space

04/16/15
Installed Ubuntu on a live USB
NOTE : MORE TESTING (on other computer) SHOULD BE DONE ON USB TO VERIFY IT'S INSTALLED ON SYSTEM RATHER THAN COMPUTER 

Afterwards Every person should test this USB on their computer to see if it's bootable and has persistence
Sowmy currently has USB

04/21/15
USBs that have working persistence seem to not boot on newer versions of Windows

MUST decide if a new Linux based OS should be used as installation system instead
a new file is posted with installation to an alternative Linux system
Everyone should install that ASAP to see if it's an improvement from Ubuntu

04/24/15
Continuing with using Ubuntu because those who plan on using USB can successfully boot using older OS's. 
Other members lack a consistent access to a computer to work on.

04/30/15
BEFORE TOMORROW EVERYONE SHOULD GO ON LFS AND COMPILE A HOST PREREQUISITE SCRIPT FOR REQUIRED PACKAGES AND NEEDED LIBRARY CONSISTENCY
